# Learning Django

To run the Django application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/learning_django.git
   ```
   ```bash
   cd learning_django
   ```
1. Run the setup script:
   
   (Linux)
   ```bash
    ./setup.sh
   ```
   (Windows)
   ```bash
   .\setup.ps1
   ```
   
   This will install the dependencies and run the Django application online.

**Note:** For academic purposes, a default superuser will be created. Check the setup script for more details on this process.
